# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation for incident.io integration. The project is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Development Environment

This is a Python project using pyenv for virtual environment management. The development setup uses:
- Python 3.11.4
- pyenv virtual environment named "incident-io-mcp-server"
- Dependencies installation is still to be configured (TODO in README)

## Project Status

The repository is newly initialized with only basic structure files (README, LICENSE, .gitignore). The actual MCP server implementation is yet to be developed.
